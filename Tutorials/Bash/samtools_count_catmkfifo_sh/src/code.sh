# samtools_count_catmkfifo_sh 0.0.1
#
# This app performs a SAMtools count via the following implementation:
#   - Bam file download is performed via dx cat.
#   - Files are handled using FIFO special files.
#     - Similar to piping, any storage on the local system is avoided.
#   - Files will be uploaded once the job is done via dx-upload-all-outputs.
#   - SAMtools is provided as a precompiled binary in resources/usr/bin.
#
# NOTE: 
#   When deciding to use FIFO special files to reduce memory requirements on machine
#   know that the same limitations that apply to pipes also apply to FIFO files.
#     - FIFO special files used with a command/script that requires random access will fail/hang.
#     - FIFO special files need both a stdin and stdout to not block execution.

  # SECTION: Debugging setup
  # ---------------
  # The -e flag causes bash to exit at any point if there is any error,
  # the -o pipefail flag tells bash to throw an error if it encounters an error within a pipeline,
  # the -x flag causes bash to output each line as it is executed
  #
  # Create a working directory so files are easy to find if ssh is needed
  #
  # In addition we'll echo the JSON inputs to stdout
  #

  set -e -x -o pipefail
  echo "Value of mappings_bam: '${mappings_bam}'"

  #
  # SECTION: Downloading as input stream
  # ---------------------------
  # Using a FIFO special file we create a sequential file stream through cat command
  #
  # A fifo file operates as a named pipe.
  # As a result both readinga and writing must happen at the same time.
  #
  # After a dx download the downloaded BAM filename is stored in the var $sorted_bam_name
  #

  mkdir workspace
  mappings_fifo_path="workspace/${mappings_bam_name}"
  mkfifo "${mappings_fifo_path}" # FIFO file is created
  # & runs the command in the background and is needed to ensure the foreground execution isn't blocked
  # Remember fifo files need both a stdin and stdout to not block.
  dx cat "${mappings_bam}" > "${mappings_fifo_path}" &
  input_pid="$!"

  #
  # SECTION: Processing input stream to output stream
  # ----------------------------------------------------------
  # samtools view -c can be performed on the established fifo.
  #
  #   Directory structure created here ~/out/counts_txt is required to use dx-upload-all-outputs
  #   All files found in the path ~/out/<output name> will be uploaded to the corresponding
  #   <output name> specified in the dxapp.json.
  #

  mkdir -p ./out/counts_txt/

  # By providing the samtools view as a reader the named pipe can be completed and used here.
  # we'll establish a stdout to readcount.txt
  counts_fifo_path="./out/counts_txt/${mappings_bam_prefix}_counts.txt"

  mkfifo "${counts_fifo_path}" # FIFO file is created, readcount.txt
  # SAMtools count is performed with &
  # without the & this would block this shell execution since readcount.txt fifo has a stdin, but no stdout
  samtools view -c "${mappings_fifo_path}" > "${counts_fifo_path}" &
  process_pid="$!"

  #
  # SECTION: Provide job output
  # ------------------
  # By providing the dx-jobutil-add-output as a reader of readcount.txt
  # all fifo special files in our pipeline can be executed and closed.
  #

  upload_pid="$!"

  #
  # SECTION: Wait for blocked background processes to finish
  # -----------------------------------------------
  # Now that all FIFO special files have are open to both
  # reading and writing background processes can finish.

  wait -n  # "$process_pid"
  wait -n  # "$upload_pid"
