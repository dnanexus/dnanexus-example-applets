Documentation to create a distributed applet can be found on the [Developer Tutorials wiki page](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Developer-Tutorials/Parallelize-Your-App). This readme will focus on the details of this example.

## Entry points

Distributed bash-interpreter apps use bash functions to [declare entry points](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Developer-Tutorials/Parallelize-Your-App#Adding-Entry-Points-to-Your-Code). Entry points are executed on a new worker with their own system requirements. This app has the following entry points specified as bash functions:

* *main*
* *count_func*
* *sum_reads*

## Overview
### main
The *main* function takes the initial `*.bam`, generates an index `*.bai` if needed, and obtains the list of regions from the `*.bam`. Every 10 regions will be sent, as input, to the *count_func* entry point using [dx-jobutil-new-job](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Helpstrings-of-SDK-Command-Line-Utilities#dx-jobutil-new-job) command.
<!-- SECTION: Download and prepare regions for scatter -->

Job outputs from the *count_func* entry point are referenced as Job Based Object References ([JBOR](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/API-Specification-v1.0.0/Job-Input-and-Output#Job-Dependencies)) and used as inputs for the *sum_reads* entry point.
<!-- SECTION: Merge results -->

Job outputs of the *sum_reads* entry point is used as the output of the *main* entry point via JBOR reference in [dx-jobutil-add-output](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Helpstrings-of-SDK-Command-Line-Utilities#dx-jobutil-add-output) command.
<!-- SECTION: Output results -->

### count_func
This entry point performs a SAMtools count of the 10 regions passed as input. Execution will be run on a new worker, as a result variables from other functions, main() for example, will not be accessible here.

Once the output file with counts is created it is uploaded to the platform and assigned as the entry point job output "counts_txt" via [dx-jobutil-add-output](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Helpstrings-of-SDK-Command-Line-Utilities#dx-jobutil-add-output).
<!-- SECTION: count_func -->

### sum_reads
The *main* entry point triggers this sub job, providing the output of *count_func* as an input JBOR. This entry point gathers all the readcount.txt files generated by the *count_func* jobs and sums the totals.

returns read_sum as a JBOR, which is then referenced as job output.
