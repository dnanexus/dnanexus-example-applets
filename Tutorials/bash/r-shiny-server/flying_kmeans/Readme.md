# Flying K-Means (DNAnexus Platform App)

Shiny Server on DNAnexus

This is the simplest method of creating a Shiny app on DNAnexus platform and is useful if
you want to create the app with the least effort. It will pull everything it needs from 
the internet on-the-fly: an example Shiny app's R source code and Shiny Server's docker image.
