#!/bin/bash
# This app performs a SAMtools count via the following implementation:
#   - Bam file is required
#     - If bam is not sorted then will be automatically sorted then indexed
#   - Input bam will be split in smaller bams based on chromosomes
#   - View options will be determined based on user input.
#     - Will be parsed to provided a valid set of inputs
#   - count will be performed in parallel on each bam file using xargs
#   - Samtools is provided as a precompiled binary in resources/usr/bin

  # Debugging Setup
  # ---------------
  # Set up logging and exit on error.
  #

  #
  # SECTION: Download and segment bam file
  # -----------------------------
  # If the input bam was not sorted by coordinate, which we can detect by attempting
  # to index it, don't fail, but instead attempt to sort and index again.
  #
  # A file with the names of each bam file is created for use by xargs
  #

    samtools sort -o "${mappings_bam_name}" "${mappings_bam_name}"
    samtools index "${mappings_bam_name}"
    bam_filename="${mappings_bam_name}"
  fi

  # Pull out chromosomes
  # --------------------
  # Examine the header of the bam file, pulling out just the @SQ lines (which contain
  # the chromosomes, grab the column with just the chromosome name, and match it to a
  # regex designed to capture canonical chromosomes

  chromosomes=$(samtools view -H "${bam_filename}" | grep "\@SQ" | awk -F '\t' '{print $2}' | awk -F ':' '{if ($2 ~ /^chr[0-9XYM]+$|^[0-9XYM]/) {print $2}}')

  for chr in $chromosomes; do
    samtools view -b "${bam_filename}" "${chr}" -o "bam_${chr}."bam
    echo "bam_${chr}.bam"
  done > bamfiles.txt

  #
  # SECTION: Xargs SAMtools count
  # --------------------
  # SAMtools count will be performed in parallel and count summary
  # will be written to file.
  #
  # View command will be built up from user input view_options
  #   $view_options is not quoted to allow word splitting
  #
