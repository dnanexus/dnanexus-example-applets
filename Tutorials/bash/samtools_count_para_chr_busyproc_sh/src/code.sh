# This app performs a SAMtools count via the following implementation:
#   - SAMmtools is provided via exec depends. Review dxapp.json for implementation.
#   - samtools view command will be run across multiple processors through control flow.
#     - Parallel by chromosome.
#   - Result will be uploaded via dx-upload-all-outputs
#
# Note: wait -n available in Ubuntu 14.04.  Review dxapp.json "distribution" field

  # SECTION: Parallel SAMtools count by region
  # ---------------------------------
  # This approach to parallelization in bash requires programatic control of processes
  # to be done from our side.  We will run called to samtools view in the background using
  # "&" bash background process.
  #
  # For the purpose of this tutorial we'll showcase core management
  # While running processes in parallel

  # Get region information from BAM headers

  # the loop will exit with active process.  This waits until all

  # SECTION: Sum and Upload results
  # --------------
  # Collect counts from 1st line of each file and sum them
  #   Files are aggregated using globs
  # Proper directory structure has to be created for dx-upload-all-outputs to function correctly
  #   For this example, the directory structure is: $HOME/out/<output var specified for this job>/<all files here will be uploaded>
  #
