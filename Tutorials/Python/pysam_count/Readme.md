This applet performs a SAMtools count on an input BAM using Pysam, a python wrapper for SAMtools.

## How is Pysam obtained

Pysam is obtained through a `pip install` using the pip package manager in the dxapp.json's `runSpec.execDepends` property:
<!-- Since JSON can't be commented cannot autogenerate below. YAML looking good right now -->

```json
{
 "runSpec": {
    ...
    "execDepends": [
      {"name": "pysam",
         "package_manager": "pip",
         "version": "0.9.1.4"
      }
    ]
    ...
 }
```

`execDepends` value is a JSON array of dependencies to resolve before the applet src code is run. In this applet, we specify `pip` as our package manager and `pysam version 0.9.1.4` as the dependency to resolve. Pysam is installed to `/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages` and can be imported by our python script.

## Downloading inputs   
`mappings_sorted_bam` and `mappings_sorted_bai` are passed to the main function as parameters for our job. These parameters are dictionary objects with key value `{"$dnanexus_link": "<file>-<xxxx>"}`. We handle file objects from the platform through [DXFile](http://autodoc.dnanexus.com/bindings/python/current/dxpy_dxfile.html?highlight=dxfile#module-dxpy.bindings.dxfile) handles. If an index file is not supplied then a `*.bai` index will be created.

## Working with Pysam
Pysam provides several methods that mimic SAMtools commands. In our applet example, we want to focus only on canonical chromosomes. Pysam's object representation of a BAM file is `pysam.AlignmentFile`.
<!--SECTION: Get chromosomes regions -->
<!-- INCLUDE: The helper function `get_chr` -->
<!-- FUNCTION: get_chr -->

Once we establish a list of canonical chromosomes, we then iterate over them and perform Pysam's version of `samtools view -c`, `pysam.AlignmentFile.count`.
<!--SECTION: Perform basic pysam count. -->

## Uploading Outputs
Our summarized counts are returned as the job output. We use the dx-toolkit python SDK's [`dxpy.upload_local_file`](http://autodoc.dnanexus.com/bindings/python/current/dxpy_dxfile.html?highlight=upload_local_file#dxpy.bindings.dxfile_functions.upload_local_file) function to upload and generate a DXFile corresponding to our tabulated result file.
<!--SECTION: Output -->

Python job outputs have to be a dictionary of key-value pairs, with the keys being job output names, as defined in the dxapp.json, and the value being the output value for corresponding output class. For files, the output type is a [DXLink](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/api-specification-v1.0.0/Details-and-Links#Linking). We use the [`dxpy.dxlink`](http://autodoc.dnanexus.com/bindings/python/current/dxpy_functions.html?highlight=dxlink#dxpy.bindings.dxdataobject_functions.dxlink) function to generate the appropriate DXLink value.
