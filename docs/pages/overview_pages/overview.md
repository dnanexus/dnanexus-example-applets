# App(let) Tutorials

Developers new to the [DNAnexus platform](https://platform.dnanexus.com/login) may find it easier to learn by doing. This repository contains a collection of simple tutorials intended to showcase common tasks and methodologies when creating an App(let) on the DNAnexus platform. The tutorials are not meant to show realistic everyday examples, but rather provide a strong starting point for App(let) developers.
