## Almost There!

Now that you're almost at the end of the Getting Started series, you're ready to start developing, building and publishing apps on the DNAnexus Platform! As you continue your journey remember; there's always more to learn and new techniques to explore when developing applications, so come back to this page as needed.

So what's Next? Depending what you're looking for, there are a couple different routes you can go from here.

## Making app(let)s

If you're looking to start cranking out app(let)s as soon as possible, I recommend taking a look the Tutorials page. Our tutorial will have a collection of best practices and how-to's when it comes to app development on the DNAnexus platform. You can take concepts from our simple examples and apply them to your specific use-case.

## Become a power user

If you're looking to dive into more advanced app(let) techniques we highly recommend taking a look at the resources page. You'll find several useful links. Two I'd like to point here:

**[DNAnexus Wiki](https://wiki.dnanexus.com)**

Our wiki is our platforms living documentation. For more advanced users, it is home to our [API specification](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/API-Specification-v1.0.0/Directory-of-API-Methods#). Our platform SDK and even our platform web-page both construct and send API request to endpoints found on this page. Understanding what API resources are available to you is an essential step to becoming a power user on the DNAnexus platform.

**[DNAnexus Autodocs](http://autodoc.dnanexus.com/bindings/python/current/)**

This contains our auto-generated documentation (with source code) of our platform SDK, dx-toolkit. A great starting point for learning how to programmatically interact with our API is to see how we interact with our API. dx-toolkit is completely open-source and available on GitHub for your perusal. A lot of the patterns you find in our SDK can be helpful in your production code.
