## Prerequisites

We assume you already have a DNAnexus account and are looking to create app(let)s on the platform. If you need to create an account please visit our [sign up page](https://platform.dnanexus.com/register) and consider giving the [website quickstart](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/UI/Quickstart) a read. Additionally, the DNAnexus SDK, dx-toolkit, must be installed to run several of the commands used in the tutorials and examples.

## Install the DNAnexus SDK

The DNAnexus SDK, dx-toolkit, provides a collection of tools to aid in the app(let) development process. While it is possible to develop and publish an app(let) using our API directly, we recommend using our SDK:

### Download dx-toolkit

dx-toolkit can be found on our wiki [Downloads](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Downloads#DNAnexus-Platform-SDK) page. Alternatively, it can be built from the [github source code](https://github.com/dnanexus/dx-toolkit).

```bash
~ $ curl -O https://wiki.dnanexus.com/images/files/dx-toolkit-v0.228.0-osx.tar.gz
~ $ tar -xvf dx-toolkit-v0.228.0-osx.tar.gz
  # A folder dx-toolkit/ will be created in the current directory
```

## source the dx-toolkit environment.

```bash
~ $ source dx-toolkit/environment
  # You are now ready to use dx commands
~ $ dx --version
  # Downloaded dx-toolkit version outputs
```

## Login to the platform

From the CLI use [`dx login`](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Command-Line-Client/Index-of-dx-Commands#login). You may wish to login with a [token](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Command-Line-Client/Login-and-Logout#Authentication-Tokens).

```bash
~ $ dx login
  Username:  # Platform username
  Password:  # Platform password
  # If this is your first-time login from the Command Line Interface then you will be prompted to select a project
  Note: Use dx select --level VIEW or dx select --public to select from projects for
  which you only have VIEW permissions.

  Available projects (CONTRIBUTE or higher):
  0) DNAnexus Example (CONTRIBUTE)
  1) My Research Project (ADMINISTER)
  
  Pick a numbered choice or "m" for more options: 1
  Setting current project to: My Research Project
```

## Create a test applet

[`dx-app-wizard`](https://wiki.dnanexus.com/Helpstrings-of-SDK-Command-Line-Utilities#dx-app-wizard) generates the directory structure required to build an app. For now, there will be no inputs or outputs we'll just use the default options when prompted.

```
~ $ dx-app-wizard
DNAnexus App Wizard, API v1.0.0

Basic Metadata

Please enter basic metadata fields that will be used to describe your app.  Optional fields are denoted by options with square brackets.  At the end of this wizard, the files necessary for building your app will be generated from the answers you provide.

  # We'll name our applet "My First Applet"

  # When the dx-app-wizard is done it'll construct a full, valid, applet directory.
  # In this case, we'll have the following directory structure:
  my_first_applet
  ├── src
  │   └── my_first_applet.sh
  │
  ├── resources/
  ├── test/
  ├── dxapp.json
  ├── Readme.md
  └── Readme.developer.md
# As you read out wiki and go through these tutorials you'll understand the role each file and directory plays in a developed app(let)
```

## Build the sample app(let)

```bash
~ $ dx build my_first_applet
{"id": "applet-xxxx"} # This is the entity-ID of the applet created in the project
```

If you are able to perform the steps above, you're ready to start creating app(let)s! Next time you or a colleague browse your project, they'll see this newly created applet.
